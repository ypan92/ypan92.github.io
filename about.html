					<h2>Something about me</h2>
					<span>Software Engineer &amp; Developer</span>

					<img src="img/webuser.jpg" alt="" class="responsive-no-blk">
					<p>Who am I?  My name is Yang Pan and I’m an everyday web user striving to continually evolve my web development skills.  I recently graduated from Cal Poly (San Luis Obispo) in Spring 2016 with a B.S. in Computer Science.  I began programming my freshman year at Cal Poly.   </p>

					<p class="aboutSubtitle">Establishing Coding Fundamentals</p>
					<p>My curriculum used C as a tool for establishing coding fundamentals.  It was also used for Systems Programming in a Unix environment.  While learning the basics about data structures and algorithms, I gained experience with Java.  I was able to further strengthen my knowledge with Java in a Software Engineering course where I collaboratively created an Exam Grader Application.  This application scanned multiple choice exam sheets and returned scores based on an exam key.  </p>


					<p class="aboutSubtitle">Getting a Software Job</p>
					<p>I felt comfortable enough with my programming skills to seek a programming job and found a part time job as a software engineer intern at Moon Valley Software.  Moon Valley emphasizes business presence on the web and exposed me to the power of shared data with today’s state of interconnectivity.  Adapting to the company’s existing code base, I began working with the company’s Chrome Extension tool.  I became comfortable with JavaScript to update the Chrome Extension and C# to modify the Chrome Extension’s API.  To monitor the data this software was using, I picked up basic SQL query skills using Microsoft T-SQL with Microsoft SQL Server.  To evolve my SQL skills, I took a database class at Cal Poly.  Using MySQL, this course taught me the basics of relational algebra, integrity constraints, query aggregations, advantages of using a Database Management System (DBMS), and connecting to a SQL database from a Java program using a JDBC driver.  In a distributed computing class, I learned how to perform basic aggregation queries on Non-Relational MongoDB collections.  </p>

					<p class="aboutSubtitle">Advancing my Skills</p>
					<p>These newly established database skills allowed me to perform more complex data requests made by the customers of Moon Valley Software.  As my responsibilities in the company grew, I began working more on the company’s website.  Stepping through code executions provided me with insight on how a frontend web page communicates with a backend web service.  I picked up on the fundamentals of Model View Controller (MVC) architecture.  </p>

					<p class="aboutSubtitle">Latest Works</p>
					<p>In my final year at Cal Poly, I dedicated my Senior Project to an ecommerce web application.  The idea was called “iconmerce” and it was an ecommerce application that sold icons as products.  In the web application, I used the MAMP stack (Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP) to implement user account data persistence.  To establish quick front-end designs, I used the Bootstrap 3 framework with various custom CSS rules to style the theme of the website.  To communicate with the MySQL database, I created a RESTful API Web Service in PHP using a framework called Slim.  This web service provided endpoints to perform operations on the database and returned any requested data in JSON format.  To keep the endpoints for this web service live all the time, I hosted it on Amazon Web Services (AWS) – Elastic Beanstalk Application.  Having database connectivity via an API web service proved useful, as I was able to reuse it when creating an iOS application of the iconmerce app.  I exercised the Swift skills I acquired in an iOS class to create the app in Xcode.  The iOS app exercised the MVC design paradigm to retrieve and modify data via network requests to my API.  Both the web application and iOS application used the Stripe payment API to process credit card payments.  This application was created for educational purposes, so only the Test Version of the payment processing is live.  This allows any user to use a test credit card number provided by Stripe to process payment without actually charging anyone.  I felt excited after successfully creating an application that keeps track of user accounts with login/sign up services, manages a shopping cart for products to be added, removed, or checked out, and processed payments for checked out items with credit card authentication services.  While developing iconmerce, I also took an Android Mobile Application class.  Learning about the Activity Lifecycle, I created a Finance application called “Financify,” which displayed visual representations of finance transactions to help me keep track of my money and spending.  I seek to continue to evolve my skills to become comfortable with even more technologies.</p>
